### C Search Algorithms Project
# ALX: C, Algorithm

## Introduction
Welcome to the C Search Algorithms project! This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on implementing various search algorithms in C and understanding their time complexities.
In this project, you will implement multiple search algorithms and analyze their efficiency. The goal is to deepen your understanding of how search algorithms work, their use cases, and their performance characteristics.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Implement different search algorithms in C.
- Understand the time complexity of each search algorithm.
- Compare the efficiency of different search algorithms.
- Apply the appropriate search algorithm based on the problem requirements.

## Search Algorithms
Here are the search algorithms you will be working on in this project:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Jump Search
4. Interpolation Search
5. Exponential Search
6. Fibonacci Search

## Requirements
- All your files should end with a new line.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.
- Your code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- No more than 5 functions per line

## Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way:
```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o search_algorithm```

## Usage
To run the program:
```./search_algorithm```

## Time Complexity
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n)
- Jump Search: O(âˆšn)
- Interpolation Search: O(log log n) on average
- Exponential Search: O(log n)
- Fibonacci Search: O(log n)
